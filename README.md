Wiki Walker is a java program that creates a site map that contains articles with links to other articles. 

The goal of the program is to have methods that can, add given articles, count the clicks it would take from one article to another, and return a list of the most likely trajectory from a starting article with k length of the desired trajectory. 

The purpose of this program is to practice using tree maps, hash maps, hash sets, queues, iterators, and lists.
